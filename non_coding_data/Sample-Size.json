We select a sample of size NNN and examine the sample's conversion rate, denoted by P^\\hat{P}P^, what is the minimum sample size NNN such that Prob(\u2223P^\u2212P\u2223<\u03b4)=95%Prob(| \\hat{P} - P | < \\delta ) = 95\\%Prob(\u2223P^\u2212P\u2223<\u03b4)=95%? In other words, find the minimum sample size N such that our sample estimate P^\\hat{P}P^ is within \u03b4\\delta\u03b4 of the true click-through rate PPP, with 95% confidence.", "solution": ""}
